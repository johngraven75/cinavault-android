# Repository Engineering Standard

Mandatory for all AI-assisted engineering. Before code, define the product goal, target user, measurable success criteria, non-goals, assumptions, and missing requirements. Propose architecture first: platform constraints, security boundaries, dependency direction, public contracts, persistence, lifecycle, observability, backward compatibility, upgrades, and rollback.

Organize work as **Frontend**, **Connector / integration**, and **Backend** where applicable. Break substantial work into small independently testable vertical slices suitable for isolated git worktrees/branches. For each slice define exact files, public interfaces/contracts, validation/error handling, logging/telemetry, security implications, and definition of done. Keep commits atomic and conventional; never merge around failing required checks.

Ship fresh, idiomatic, repository-specific production code following SOLID, DRY, explicit typing, immutable data where practical, dependency injection, narrow interfaces, secure defaults, input validation, null safety, cancellation/disposal, bounded resources, and clear separation of concerns. No TODOs, placeholders, mock data, fabricated integrations, credentials, or incomplete production paths. Preserve accepted functionality and backward compatibility unless an explicit migration is approved.

Every slice requires appropriate unit tests for edge/failure cases, real filesystem/OS integration tests, API/IPC contract tests, security tests for injection/traversal/unsafe deserialization/privilege escalation, performance tests with measurable budgets, and manual QA for UI/install/upgrade flows. Run formatting, linting, static analysis, type checks, unit/integration/E2E, packaging, and user-flow validation. Never weaken tests to obtain green CI.

Before completion, self-review normal and failure paths for races, deadlocks, leaks, disposal, cancellation, retries, lifecycle cleanup, permissions, interrupted operations, rollback, and compatibility; fix discovered issues first.

Production readiness requires a diff summary, changelog/release notes, migration/install notes, public API docs, environment/config docs, rollback plan, post-release monitoring plan, and test/checksum evidence for packaged artifacts. Never claim completion/publication/signing/test success without evidence. Commit every change before building and rerun validation after each fix.
